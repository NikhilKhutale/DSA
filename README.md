## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and are essential for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository serves as a centralized resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts. Here, you'll find detailed explanations of algorithms and data structures, along with implementations in various programming languages.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **algorithms/**: Contains explanations and implementations of algorithms categorized by type (e.g., sorting, searching).
- **data_structures/**: Provides explanations and implementations of various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees).
- **problems/**: Includes problem statements and solutions categorized by topic (e.g., array problems, graph problems).
- **resources/**: Contains additional materials such as textbooks, images, and research papers related to DSA.
